      is_maintained: Is Maintained
      is_maintained_desc: Percentage of weeks with at least one code commit in the

      is_maintained_more:
        weight: 13.853%
        threshold: 100%
        detail: This metric is used to determine whether the repository is being maintained
          on an ongoing basis. An actively maintained projects may be more resistant
          to risks such as vulnerabilities. It is related to the Commit Frequency,
          but the focus is different. The former focuses on the number of code contributions
          during the cycle, while the latter focuses on the continuity of the code
          contributions. But we should not draw any direct conclusions about projects
          that are low on this indicator, and further insights are needed.
        notes: definitions of single repository and multiple repositories are differerent.

      commit_pr_linked_ratio_more:
        weight: 12.612%
        threshold: 100%
        detail: This indicator is used to determine whether the code submission has
          gone through the PR process. To determine whether a project is open source,
          perhaps we can verify the License it declares. But whether open source projects
          use open community collaboration model to develop, and whether the community
          is willing to build community with open source contributors and organizational
          partners, it is not enough to rely on License alone. Here we examine the
          project's willingness to collaborate by informing contributors in an open
          and transparent manner about the purpose of the code submission, whether
          it is a PR or not, and by being reviewed.
      commit_count: Commit Count
      commit_count_desc: Determine the number of commits in the past 90 days.

      commit_pr_linked_count_desc: Determine the numbers of new code commit link pull
        request in the last 90 days.
      created_since: Created Since
      created_since_desc: Determine how long a repository has existed since it was
        created (in months).
      created_since_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 120
      updated_since: Updated Since
      updated_since_desc: Determine the average time per repository since the repository
        was last updated (in days).
      updated_since_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 0.25
      updated_since_more:
        weight: 12.74%
        threshold: 0.25 months
        detail: This metric is used to indicate how often the project is updated.
          It identifies good communities for development collaboration and management,
          and makes frequent iterative and incremental development to promote continuous
          improvement in software quality. But the industr domains of a software project
          also determines that the frequency of its iterations is not always as high
          as possible, some Linux distribution projects, for example, exhibit a very
          typical pattern of code iterations with periodic release planning. Here
          we focus on the trend of the project during each cycle, and the relative
          results compared with the projects belong to the similar domains.
      org_count: Org Count
      org_count_desc: Number of organizations to which active code contributors belong
        in the past 90 days.
      org_count_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 30
      org_count_more:
        weight: 32.258%
        threshold: '30'
        detail: What we count here are the organizations that contribute code. The
          reason for only counting code contributions is that code contributions have
          the highest technical threshold compared to other types of community contributions,
          and are the most direct manifestation of an organization's participation
          in community contributions. At the same time through the analysis of the
          organization's categories, we can also be more in-depth insight, such as
          understanding of the project's north-south ecological construction, etc.
      org_commit_frequency: Org Commit Frequency
      org_commit_frequency_desc: 'Definition: Determine the average number of commits
        with organization affiliation per week in the past 90 days.'

        threshold: Between 0 and 800
      org_contribution_last: Org contribution last
      org_contribution_last_desc: Total contribution time of all organizations to
        the community in the past 90 days (weeks).
      org_contribution_last_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 160
      lines_of_code_frequency: Lines of Code Frequency
      lines_of_code_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of lines touched
        (lines added plus lines removed) per week in the past 90 days.
      lines_of_code_frequency_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 300000
      lines_of_code_frequency_more:
        weight: 5.640%
        threshold: '300000'
        detail: The number of lines of source code is indeed strongly correlated with
          the amount of work, but it is less correlated with the value created. What
          forms of code can be counted in the LOC, are uncertain factors. We do not
          care so much about the code form(program language, configuration files etc),
          only use it as the description of the workload, so its weight in the overall
          metrics model is low.
      lines_add_of_code_frequency: Lines Add of Code Frequency
      lines_add_of_code_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of lines touched
        (lines added) per week in the past 90.

    collaboration_development_index:
      title: Collaboration Development Index
      desc: Open source projects, as a typical manifestation of human group intelligence,
        the ability to establish collaborative development management is a key element
        contributing to the success of the project. And code, as the final output
        of a project, is the essence of the entire community's contribution. So we
        evaluate how well the development process is managed and how well the community
        does collaborative development around a series of indirect metrics related
        to code contribution.
      metrics:
        contributor_count: Code Contributor Count
        contributor_count_desc: Determine how many active pr creators, code reviewers,
          commit authors there are in the past 90 days.
        contributor_count_more:
          weight: 19.987%
          threshold: '1000'
          detail: Here we focus on the number of contributors directly related to
            the code contribution. As a result of this model, it identifies a well-managed
            community of development collaborations that are gathering more and more
            active code contributors. We believe that some types of the Issue are
            also related to code contributions, such as Bug , new requirements, and
            so on, and will eventually introduce code contributions. But as a general
            indicator, it is difficult to identify issues in a uniform way (such as
            a Bug type) within the specific type of each project, because each project
            has a different definition and understanding of the Bug type. So we made
            a trade-off, choosing only PR-related and Code Commit-related contributors
            as insight objects.
        commit_frequency: Commit Frequency
        commit_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of commits per week in
          the past 90 days.
        commit_frequency_more:
          weight: 16.363%
          threshold: '1000'
          detail: As an outcome indicator of this model, it identifies the sustainability
            and quantity of project contributions. Refers to the overall workload
            of the project.
        is_maintained: Is Maintained
        is_maintained_desc: Percentage of weeks with at least one code commit in the
          past 90 days(single repository). Percentage of code repositories with at
          least one code commit in the last 30 days(multiple repositories).
        is_maintained_more:
          weight: 13.853%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: This metric is used to determine whether the repository is being
            maintained on an ongoing basis. An actively maintained projects may be
            more resistant to risks such as vulnerabilities. It is related to the
            Commit Frequency, but the focus is different. The former focuses on the
            number of code contributions during the cycle, while the latter focuses
            on the continuity of the code contributions. But we should not draw any
            direct conclusions about projects that are low on this indicator, and
            further insights are needed.
          notes: definitions of single repository and multiple repositories are differerent.
        commit_pr_linked_ratio: Commit PR Linked Ratio
        commit_pr_linked_ratio_desc: Determine the percentage of new code commit link
          pull request in the last 90 days.
        commit_pr_linked_ratio_more:
          weight: 12.612%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: This indicator is used to determine whether the code submission
            has gone through the PR process. To determine whether a project is open
            source, perhaps we can verify the License it declares. But whether open
            source projects use open community collaboration model to develop, and
            whether the community is willing to build community with open source contributors
            and organizational partners, it is not enough to rely on License alone.
            Here we examine the project's willingness to collaborate by informing
            contributors in an open and transparent manner about the purpose of the
            code submission, whether it is a PR or not, and by being reviewed.
        pr_issue_linked_ratio: PR Issue Linked Ratio
        pr_issue_linked_ratio_desc: Determine the percentage of new pull request link
          issues in the last 90 days.
        pr_issue_linked_ratio_more:
          weight: 11.319%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: This metric is used to see if the code contributions are based upon
            open discussion, for example using the Issue. Note that not all issues
            result in code contributions, such as an Issue for the advisory type,
            there would be no code modifications generally . At the same time, we
            should also note that if PR goes through public discussion, Issue is not
            the only way, it may come from discussion in the forum. Therefore, we
            can not blindly pursue the high proportion of this indicator.
        code_review_ratio: Code Review Ratio
        code_review_ratio_desc: Determine the percentage of code commits with at least
          one reviewer (not PR creator) in the last 90 days.
        code_review_ratio_more:
          weight: 10.113%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: If a PR is merged without being reviewed by others, the probability
            of a code defect or vulnerability being introduced, intentionally or unintentionally,
            is greatly increased. Code reviews do not fully protect against this risk,
            but they greatly improve the introduction of risk.
        code_merge_ratio: Code Merge Ratio
        code_merge_ratio_desc: Determine the percentage of PR Mergers and PR authors
          who are not the same person in the last 90 days of commits.
        code_merge_ratio_more:
          weight: 10.113%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: This metric was observed in conjunction with the Code Review Ratio.
            When we introduced a third-party review, but if the PR creator intentionally
            or unintentionally ignored the third-party review and merged the code
            directly, there are also risks. It's important to note that the Code Review
            Ratio and Code Merge Ratio are one best practices we observe in opensource
            communities, but rather the only standards. We also see in some communities
            based on trust in some good, long-term contributors, these people are
            granted the right to merge their own code direclty.
        lines_of_code_frequency: Lines of Code Frequency
        lines_of_code_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of lines touched
          (lines added plus lines removed) per week in the past 90 days.
        lines_of_code_frequency_more:
          weight: 5.640%
          threshold: '300000'
          detail: The number of lines of source code is indeed strongly correlated
            with the amount of work, but it is less correlated with the value created.
            What forms of code can be counted in the LOC, are uncertain factors. We
            do not care so much about the code form(program language, configuration
            files etc), only use it as the description of the workload, so its weight
            in the overall metrics model is low.
    community_service_and_support:
      title: Community Service and Support
      desc: Community Service and Support measures the quality of services and support
        provided by the community as directly perceived by a developer during the
        contribution process. The emphasis on direct perception comes from the fact
        that many of the underlying services provided by the community, such as the
        Devops infrastructure involved in the development, are also key elements in
        building community services, but are difficult for the community participants
        to perceive. At the same time, they are also lack of a universal means of
        assessment. We use the metric dimension that participants perceive in community-based
        development to indirectly evaluate the community's entire 'Marathon-like logistic
        system in open source contribution'. It should be noted that this does not
        mean that only the metrics mentioned in the model are sufficient, in order
        to ensure the independence of indicators, the model has done a strong correlation
        index dimension reduction; So if you want to maintain the long-term positive
        development of the model, the community's efforts go far beyond what the current
        metrics contain.
      metrics:
        updated_issues_count: Updated Issues Count
        updated_issues_count_desc: Determine the number of issues updated in the last
          90 days.
        updated_issues_count_more:
          weight: 19.721%
          threshold: '2000'
          detail: There are two reasons why we chose to use the number of Issue updates
            instead of counting the number of issues that were closed or resolved.
            First, there are many different types of issues, such as bugs, new function
            requirements, user inquiries, and CVEs. Only certain types of problems,
            such as CVES, must be resolved quickly. For other types of issues, quick
            Issue resolution is not pursued usually, and we need to communicate with
            the issue creator multiple times to better understand the details that
            takes time. If the functional requirements, from acceptance to resolution,
            are in accordance with the release plan, such scenarios may also take
            several months. Second, from the number of Issue updates, we can monitor
            the activity of the Issue processing. The issue update can also include
            reopening the issue, indicating concern about changes in the understanding
            of the issue.
        close_pr_count: Close PR Count
        close_pr_count_desc: The number of PR accepted and declined in the last 90
          days.
        close_pr_count_more:
          weight: 19.721%
          threshold: '4500'
          detail: The more code you contribute, the more PR requests you need to close
            (accept or reject) . This indicates that the community is actively dealing
            with the PR. We use this metric together with Close PR Count as an outcome
            measure of the model, to provide an overall view of community service
            and support.
        issue_first_response: Issue First Response
        issue_first_response_desc: Average/Median first comments response (in days)
          for new issues created in the last 90 days. This excludes bot responses,
          the creator's own comment, or an action assigned by the issue. If the issue
          has been unanswered, the first response time is not counted.
        issue_first_response_more:
          weight: 14.372%
          threshold: 15 days
          detail: We use this indicator to sense "Community temperature". And for
            contributors who join the community, if their questions are answered in
            a timely manner by the community, there's a good chance that they would
            be retained and continue to contribute to the community (according to
            Mozilla Research) . At the same time, we found that more and more robots
            have been used to assist with Issue processing in recent years, so we
            eliminated robot interference and focused on human replies.
        bug_issue_open_time: Bug Issue Open Time
        bug_issue_open_time_desc: Average/Median time (days) that bug issues have
          been opened for issues created in the last 90 days.
        bug_issue_open_time_more:
          weight: 12.88%
          threshold: 60 days
          notes: Issue that labeled by Bugs.
          detail: The Bug type Issue represents how efficiently the community handles
            issues that need to be resolved quickly. We chose to use Bug Issue to
            represent this type of Issues, which of course has its limitations, because
            not all bugs are high-priority ones, but rather than not distinguishing
            the Issue types, this index has some representativeness.
        pr_open_time: PR Open Time
        pr_open_time_desc: Average/Median processing time (days) for new change requests
          created in the last 90 days, including closed/accepted change requests and
          unresolved change requests.
        pr_open_time_more:
          weight: 12.88%
          threshold: 30 days
          detail: We are seeking for the change request fast close, including code
            merged or rejected. Otherwise the longer it takes for a change request
            to be resolved, the greater the risk that merge-conflict will occur, while
            other change requests that depend on it will also be stalled.

          threshold: '5'
          detail: We would like to see the community encourage open and transparent
            discussion around specific bugs or requirements through Issue. The corresponding
            conclusions of the Issue can also be accumulated as a knowledge base and
            made available to more people.
        code_review_count: Code Review Count
        code_review_count_desc: Determine the average number of review comments per
          pull request created in the last 90 days.
        code_review_count_more:
          weight: 10.217%
          threshold: '8'
          detail: We hope that code could be reviewed publicly by PR that shows how
            much the community values code quality and security management, and helps
            new people grow quickly.
    community_activity:
      title: Community Activity
      desc: Community Activity is used to describe how active an open source community
        is.In order for an open source project to be sustainable, it must continue
        to be maintained and improved following its initial release. Activity describes
        how much work is being done on a project over time. High levels of community
        activity may indicate that a project is sustainable and low levels of community
        activity may indicate that a project is at risk.
      metrics:
        contributor_count: Contributor Count
        contributor_count_desc: Determine how many active code commit authors, pr
          authors, review participants, issue authors, and issue comments participants
          there are in the past 90 days.
        contributor_count_more:
          weight: 18.01%
          threshold: '2000'
          notes: when a person has more than one contributions with different roles
            in multiple repositories, like code commit author and issue author, we
            only count once.
          detail: In this model, we include all types of contributors to the project
            hosted by code host platform(Github, Gitee etc). Because we think that
            project activity is made up of all types of contributing behavior, and
            the more active contributors there are, the more important the project
            is.
        commit_frequency: Commit Frequency
        commit_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of commits per week in
          the past 90 days.
        commit_frequency_more:
          weight: 18.01%
          threshold: '1000'
          detail: As an outcome indicator of this model, it identifies the sustainability
            and quantity of project contributions. Refers to the overall workload
            of the project.
        updated_since: Updated Since
        updated_since_desc: Determine the average time per repository since the repository
          was last updated (in days).
        updated_since_more:
          weight: 12.74%
          threshold: 0.25 months
          detail: This metric is used to indicate how often the project is updated.
            It identifies good communities for development collaboration and management,
            and makes frequent iterative and incremental development to promote continuous
            improvement in software quality. But the industr domains of a software
            project also determines that the frequency of its iterations is not always
            as high as possible, some Linux distribution projects, for example, exhibit
            a very typical pattern of code iterations with periodic release planning.
            Here we focus on the trend of the project during each cycle, and the relative
            results compared with the projects belong to the similar domains.
        organization_count: Organization Count
        organization_count_desc: Number of organizations to which active code contributors
          belong in the past 90 days.
        organization_count_more:
          weight: 11.50%
          threshold: '10'
          detail: The more organizations that participate in the project's ongoing
            contribution, the more organizations that rely heavily on the project.
            This will greatly promote the establishment and prosperity of ecology.
        created_since: Created Since
        created_since_desc: Determine how long a repository has existed since it was
          created (in months).
        comment_frequency: Comment Frequency
        comment_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of comments per issue
          created in the last 90 days.
        comment_frequency_more:
          weight: 7.77%
          threshold: '5'
          detail: We would like to see the community encourage open and transparent
            discussion around specific bugs or requirements through Issue. The corresponding
            conclusions of the Issue can also be accumulated as a knowledge base and
            made available to more people.
        code_review_count: Code Review Count
        code_review_count_desc: Determine the average number of review comments per
          pull request created in the last 90 days.
        code_review_count_more:
          weight: 4.92%
          threshold: '8'
          detail: We hope that code could be reviewed publicly by PR that shows how
            much the community values code quality and security management, and helps
            new people grow quickly.
        updated_issues_count: Updated Issues Count
        updated_issues_count_desc: Determine the number of issues updated in the last
          90 days.
        updated_issues_count_more:
          weight: 4.92%
          threshold: '2500'
          detail: There are two reasons why we chose to use the number of Issue updates
            instead of counting the number of issues that were closed or resolved.
            First, there are many different types of issues, such as bugs, new function
            requirements, user inquiries, and CVEs. Only certain types of problems,
            such as CVES, must be resolved quickly. For other types of issues, quick
            Issue resolution is not pursued usually, and we need to communicate with
            the issue creator multiple times to better understand the details that
            takes time. If the functional requirements, from acceptance to resolution,
            are in accordance with the release plan, such scenarios may also take
            several months. Second, from the number of Issue updates, we can monitor
            the activity of the Issue processing. The issue update can also include
            reopening the issue, indicating concern about changes in the understanding
            of the issue.
        recent_releases_count: Recent Releases Count
        recent_releases_count_desc: Determine the number of releases in the last year.
        recent_releases_count_more:
          weight: 3.18%
          threshold: '12'
          detail: The high frequency of releases indicates that software artifacts
            are iterating rapidly to respond to user needs. Of course, software projects
            belong to different industries and fields, also decided that the frequency
            of its iterations is not always as high as possible, for example, large
            platform software project release cycle is six months to a year.
    organization_activity:
      title: Organizations Activity
      desc: Organizational activity is used to assess the activity of organizations
        in the community (Business Companies, colleges, etc.) . For an open source
        project, especially for a platform-based software project, the more organizations
        participate in community contributions, indicating that the ecological construction
        of the community is towards prosperity. Because software projects provide
        the business value or academic value-binding that organizations need, organizations
        are willing to participate in community contributions using organizations
        identities.
      metrics:
        org_count: Org Count
        org_count_desc: Number of organizations to which active code contributors
          belong in the past 90 days.
        org_count_more:
          weight: 32.258%
          threshold: '30'
          detail: What we count here are the organizations that contribute code. The
            reason for only counting code contributions is that code contributions
            have the highest technical threshold compared to other types of community
            contributions, and are the most direct manifestation of an organization's
            participation in community contributions. At the same time through the
            analysis of the organization's categories, we can also be more in-depth
            insight, such as understanding of the project's north-south ecological
            construction, etc.
        contributor_count: Organization Contributor Count
        contributor_count_desc: Number of active code contributors with organization
          affiliation in the past 90 days.
        contributor_count_more:
          weight: 25.806%
          threshold: '300'
          detail: Here we count the number of code contributors with organized attributes.
            We are here to examine the organization's continued investment in community
            human resources.
        commit_frequency: Commit Frequency
        commit_frequency_desc: 'Definition: Determine the average number of commits
          with organization affiliation per week in the past 90 days.'
        commit_frequency_more:
          weight: 25.81%
          threshold: '800'
          detail: This indicator is similar to the number of contributors and measures
            the organization's input to the community in terms of the number of code
            contributions.
        contribution_last: Contribution Last
        contribution_last_desc: Total contribution time of all organizations to the
          community in the past 90 days (weeks).
        contribution_last_more:
          weight: 16.13%
          threshold: '200'
          detail: We look at the development of ecology in terms of the time dimension,
            through how the organization participates and invests as time goes by.
